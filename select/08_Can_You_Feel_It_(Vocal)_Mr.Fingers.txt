Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
In the beginning there was Jack,
And Jack had a groove,
And from this groove came the groove of all grooves.
And while one day viciously throwing down on his box,
Jack boldly declared,
"Let there be house",
And house music was born.
"I am", you see, "I am the creator,
And this is my house,
And in my house there is only house music.
But I am not so selfish because once you enter my house,
It then becomes our house
And our house music."
"And you see,
No one man owns house,
Because house music is a universal language
Spoken and understood by all.
You see house is a feelin'
That no one can understand really
Unless you deep into the vibe of house.
House is a uncontrollable desire to jack your body,
And as I told you before,
This is our house
And our house music."
And in every house understand that there is a keeper,
And in this house the keeper's name is Jack.
Now some of you might wonder
Who is Jack
And what is it that Jack does.
Jack is the one who gives you the power to jack your body.
Jack is the one who gives you the power to do the snake.
Jack is the one who gives you the key to the wiggly worm.
Jack is the one who learns you how to wop your body.
Jack is the one that can bring nations and nations of all jackers
Together under one house,
You maybe black,
You maybe white,
You maybe jew,
Or gentile,
It don't make a difference in our house
And this is fresh.
