What do you have in store?
One life away you can't explore
But I don't want to get
in the way no more
'Cause this the type of feeling
you can't ignore
I'm ready to break down the door
Settle the score,
I can't let you go away
I miss the smile of your face
You know that
I lo-lo-lo-love the chase
You told me once
that I was crazy
I said, "Baby girl, I know"
But I can't let you go away
So don't you get me started now
I want a yes,
I don't want maybes
'Cause they leave me
where you found me
So don't leave
Ooh
I just love the way
you got me feeling
And now I feel it
It's like ooh
Take away the pain, baby,
I'm healing
Baby, I'm healing
I don't need anything more
Be the wave, I'll be the shore
Crashing all over me
I want you
What do you have in store?
Type of girl that make me
drop dead on the floor
This the only girl
that I love and adore
This the type of love
that you can't ignore
I said, hey! She comin' my way
She running 'round saying
whatever she wanna say
I told her I don't wanna
have to do this every day
Told her that I love her
but she thinkin' it's a game
Oh no! Now she uncomfortable
Never wanna make it
the one dimensional
Oh yeah, oh-na-na-na
Don't know how we got here,
don't you get me started now
You told me once
that I was crazy
I said, "Baby girl, I know"
But I can't let you go away
So don't you get me started now
I want a yes,
I don't want maybes
'Cause they leave me
where you found me
So don't leave
Ooh
I just love the way
you got me feeling
And now I feel it
It's like ooh
Take away the pain, baby,
I'm healing
Baby, I'm healing
I don't need anything more
Be the wave, I'll be the shore
Crashing all over me
I want you
